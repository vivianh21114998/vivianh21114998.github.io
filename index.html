  <h2> Introduction and Early History</h2>                                                                                                            
<p> Founded in 1995 in Los Angeles, Lifehouse is an alternative rock band (some consider them to be Christian). The original band name was called Blyss from 1995-2000.<br> 
  The members consist of Jason Wade as the lead singer and guitarist, Rick Woolstenhulme Jr. as the drummer, and Bryce Soderberg as the bassist. They were most famous<br>
  during the 2000s, but they are still creating music. As of 2018, their most recent released album was called <em>Out of the Wastelands</em>.<br>
  Their first successful album was <em>No Name Face</em> in 2000. The band's first song to reach the Billboard chart was "Hanging by a Moment," which was the third<br>
  song in chart history to be named the <strong>"No.1 Song of the Year."</strong></p>

  <h2>"You and Me" Song Lyrics Excerpt</h2>
  <p class="song-lyrics">What day is it<br>
And in what month<br>
    This clock never seemed so alive<br>
I can't keep up and I can't back down<br>
    I've been losing so much time<br></p> 
  <p class="song-lyrics">Cause there's <strong class="big">you and me</strong><br>
And of all people with nothing to do<br>
Nothing to lose<br>
And there's <strong class="big">you and me</strong><br>
And of all other people<br>
And I don't know why<br>
  I can't keep my eyes off of you<br></p> 
<p class="song-lyrics"> What are the things That I want to say<br>
Just aren't coming out right<br>
I'm tripping on words<br>
  You got my head spinning<br>
  I don't know where to go from here...<br></p>
