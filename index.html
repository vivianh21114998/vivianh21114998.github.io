  <h2><em>You and Me</em> Song Lyrics Excerpt</h2>
  <p class="song-lyrics">What day is it<br>
And in what month<br>
    This clock never seemed so alive<br>
I can't keep up and I can't back down<br>
    I've been losing so much time<br></p> 
  <p class="song-lyrics">Cause there's <strong class="big">you and me</strong><br>
And of all people with nothing to do<br>
Nothing to lose<br>
And there's <strong>you and me</strong><br>
And of all other people<br>
And I don't know why<br>
  I can't keep my eyes off of you<br></p> 
<p class="song-lyrics"> What are the things That I want to say<br>
Just aren't coming out right<br>
I'm tripping on words<br>
  You got my head spinning<br>
  I don't know where to go from here...<br></p>
